# Network-Analysis-of-Airport-Connectivity
This project analyzes airport network connectivity patterns using Python and NetworkX. The analysis includes:

Visualization and analysis of degree distribution using log-log plots
Calculation of global clustering coefficients
Comparison with random network models (Erdős-Rényi and Configuration models)
Analysis of network properties including:

Node and edge counts
Average degree distributions
Network transitivity
Subcritical regime analysis



Key Features

Implementation of network science concepts and graph theory
Data visualization using matplotlib
Comparative analysis between empirical airport network and theoretical network models
Mathematical analysis of network parameters and thresholds

Technical Stack

Python
NetworkX for graph analysis
Matplotlib for visualization
NumPy for numerical computations

The project provides insights into the topological structure of airport networks and demonstrates how they differ from random network models, particularly in terms of degree distribution and clustering patterns.
